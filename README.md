# Learning Jenkins
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `Learning Jenkins`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

_See the README file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `01_03` corresponds to the first chapter and the third video in that chapter.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
